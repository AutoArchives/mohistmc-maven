master Changelog
2.2
===
 - 2.2.19 Fix missed testing line
 - 2.2.18 Fix class signature verification error for multi-release jars. Closes #3
 - 2.2.17 Fix package-infos not being loaded for packages that define version information in the manifest.
 - 2.2.16 Add ClassLoader test framework and some signature tests
 - 2.2.15 Re-work test projects to be able to generate test jars
          Signatures contain timestamps so only regen if needed
          Add multi-release jar test template
 - 2.2.14 Bump ASM and fix providers with comments
 - 2.2.13 Declare our artifact's rename.
 - 2.2.12 Fix erroneous identity comparison in `UnionFileSystem#newDirStream` and remove redundant checks (#1)
 - 2.2.11 Fix potential duplicate returns in getResources
          ClassLoaders make no garentee about uniqueness, but this case is simple enough to detect
 - 2.2.10 Bypass ZipFileSystem's production of invalid URIs when zip filenames are not properly url encoded.
 - 2.2.9  Bump github action's java version
 - 2.2.8  Fix early return in getMaybeTransformedClassBytes
 - 2.2.7  Revert back to wrapping any non-default paths in a Union File System
          Added more sanitization to the UFS Key generator
          Not doing so breaks some poorly written FileSystems
          We will still benefit for the majority of libraries/mods.
 - 2.2.6  Allow explicitly specifying parent classloader list to SecureModuleClassLoader
          Add debugging options to SMCL
          Fix issue with getResources not enumerating full list.
 - 2.2.5  Fix issue when opening the same jar file multiple times.
 - 2.2.4  Fix Union URL issue when in powerful classloaders.
          Cleanup code to better separate api.
          Deprecate concept of passing in a default manifest.
 - 2.2.3  Add option to force all classes in a package to use the same CodeSigner's.
          This is required by the base ClassLoader because it will refuse to load a class that doesn't match certificates.
          In Minecraft we modify code at runtime all the time, as well as inject runtime generated classes into the same package as existing code.
          This essentially makes the runtime signature data completely useless, so why is this project even a thing?
 - 2.2.2  Add github actions for publishing.
 - 2.2.1  Add missing licenses to test sub-project
 - 2.2.0  Move project to Forge namespace, and rename to SecureModules
          Rewrite the ClassLoader to properly find resources from parent layers, support supplying a parent class loader and be easier to understand.
          Compatibility with cpw land SecureJarHandler is kept until next major breaking window. Targeting MC 1.21 if I don't forget.
          This project will need to be re-evaluated on if it even is necessary in the MC runtime at all.
          Yes, Jar signatures/code signers are great. However we exist in a world of coremods and runtime bytecode manipulation. There is no possible runtime security need for this.
          Things should be addressed in the MC universe using static analysis of the jar files themselves not runtime. Which can be done in a FAR simpler manor.

2.1
===
 - 2.1.11 Restructure project in a manor that actually allows people to develop for it.
          Introduce proper testing and benchmark aggregating.
          Build a proper modularized gradle project.
          Remove all useless command line arguments.
          Cleanup a bunch of code warnings, the ones remaining require functional/structural changes and will be done later.
 - 2.1.10 Fix issue with JarInJar, probably.
 - 2.1.9  Merge pull request #41
          * Try and make ourselves a lot less vulnerable to Thread interruption, …
          * Try and detect if we've lost our zipfilesystem due to an unexpected c…
 - 2.1.8  Force it to detect the 1.x branch
 - 2.1.7  Add all a.b branches as buildable remote targets for release.
 - 2.1.6  Make version guessing more robust, and error messages more informative. (#38)
 - 2.1.5  Fix version guessing for paths without extensions, or extensions other then .jar (#34)
 - 2.1.4  Use StringBuilder not StringJoiner for a small efficiency bonus..
 - 2.1.3  Avoid using Pattern and Streams in UnionPath init
          Speeds up creation of UnionPath significantly. Reduces time spend in testJarFileExists from 7585 to 2777, other tests like testCommonPathUtilities see improvements as well
 - 2.1.2  Add tests for dir walking, and and optimize the directory stream
          to not construct so many strings thru pattern matching. Also SPLIT is a regex. Also add JFR JMH profiler option, useful for inspecting traces
 - 2.1.1  Static patterns rather than implicit, for another 10% improvement in performance.
 - 2.1.0  Fix up JMH test, and improve existence test performance, especially for Windows.
          Note that Windows C (system) drive seems to have some core protections enabled that will always make file access slower for it. Put your stuff on a separate partition or drive.

===
 - 0.9.69 Add support for file attribute views in the union file system provider (#18)
          * Add support for file attribute views in the union file system provider
          Fixes #17 (crash with JetBrains JVM)
          * Add file attribute tests
 - 0.9.68 Fix UnionPath (#4)
          * Fix UnionPath#relativize
          * Fix the other of the relativize method as wel land add test for reletivizing absolute union paths.
          * Went through UnionPath and change methods to behave as they should. It is pasing test now however better testing for the UnionPath methods is required.
          * Some more union path bugfixes and added tests for many other methods of UnionPath
          * Little changes to Jar to make it work with the changes and made UnionPath#getFileName return an empty string for the empty absolute path.
